# GPO to MSI
Group Policy to MSI allows an administrator to deploy the same policies to Intune managed devices as he can use with Active Directory. The easy to use wizard allows to convert a Group Policy Object (GPO) or a local Group Policy to an MSI file, which can be deployed to Intune managed clients. This will simplify the modern management of devices with different managements Systems.

The How to Guide is in our [Syntaro Wiki](https://wiki.syntaro.com/index.php?title=GPO_to_MSI).
